# Lair Minion Sustainability Scorer: Task Definitions

This document defines the tasks that compose the Lair Minion Sustainability Scorer function. Each task evaluates a specific dimension of workforce sustainability for an evil lair location and contributes to the final probability distribution across five sustainability tiers: Exceptional, Strong, Adequate, Limited, and Insufficient.

## Task 1: Living Quarters Potential Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the location's capacity to house and sustain a functioning evil workforce with appropriate accommodation for all personnel tiers.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Raw volumetric capacity for housing hundreds to thousands of personnel
- Environmental habitability (temperature, air quality, light, sanitation)
- Hierarchical accommodation potential (executive luxury for lieutenants, specialist comfort for scientists, functional barracks for guards and minions)
- Recreation and morale infrastructure (gyms, common rooms, social spaces, nature access or simulated environments)
- Expansion potential as operations scale
- Privacy/surveillance balance appropriate for evil operations

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must consider whether the location could physically support large-scale residential facilities, whether environmental conditions are tolerable for extended human habitation, and whether the space allows for the hierarchical differentiation essential to evil organizational culture. A volcanic crater with no temperature regulation fails regardless of capacity. A cramped submarine with no recreational space cannot sustain morale. The ideal location offers expansive, climate-controllable space with natural divisions supporting hierarchy.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Could comfortably house thousands with full hierarchical accommodation, excellent environmental conditions, comprehensive recreation facilities, and significant expansion potential
2. Strong: Could house hundreds to low thousands with adequate accommodation across hierarchy levels, acceptable environmental conditions, solid recreation options
3. Adequate: Could house dozens to hundreds with basic accommodation, some environmental challenges manageable with infrastructure investment, limited recreation space
4. Limited: Could house only small teams, significant environmental challenges, minimal accommodation differentiation, no recreation infrastructure
5. Insufficient: Cannot meaningfully house personnel; location is fundamentally uninhabitable or too small for workforce operations

## Task 2: Recruitment Pipeline Viability Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the location's access to sustainable streams of potential evil workforce recruits.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Proximity to populations susceptible to evil recruitment (economically desperate, politically disillusioned, ideologically sympathetic, or ambitiously amoral)
- Local economic conditions making evil employment comparatively attractive
- Cultural factors normalizing secrecy, hierarchy, violence, or service to unconventional employers
- Discretion of surrounding population (corruption accessibility, silence culture, economic complicity)
- Balance between isolation for security and accessibility for recruitment
- Diversity of recruitment source populations (guards, scientists, technicians, ninjas require different pools)

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must consider the regional context surrounding the location. A remote Pacific island may be tactically excellent but impossible to staff. An abandoned facility near economically depressed regions with military traditions offers abundant recruitment. The ideal location has access to multiple recruitment populations while maintaining sufficient isolation that recruits, once employed, cannot easily leave or communicate with outside contacts.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Multiple accessible populations with high recruitment susceptibility, favorable economic conditions, cultural normalization factors, and reliable local discretion; can sustainably staff large-scale operations indefinitely
2. Strong: Good access to recruitment populations with some logistical challenges, reasonable economic attractiveness, adequate cultural compatibility, workable local relations
3. Adequate: Recruitment possible but requires significant effort and extended logistics; limited population access, moderate economic competition from legitimate employers
4. Limited: Recruitment extremely difficult; remote from suitable populations, strong local economies competing for labor, cultural resistance to unconventional employment
5. Insufficient: No viable recruitment access; location is completely isolated from potential workforce or surrounded by populations hostile to or incompatible with evil employment

## Task 3: Training Facilities Capacity Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the location's capacity to support comprehensive evil workforce training operations.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Space for combat training (hand-to-hand, weapons drills, formation exercises)
- Weapons qualification facilities (firearm ranges, laser targeting, exotic weapons testing with safety containment)
- Tactical training environments (mock facilities for infiltration defense, hero encounter simulation)
- Environmental adaptation training capacity (if location has unusual conditions)
- Obstacle courses and physical conditioning infrastructure
- Experimental equipment and vehicle testing grounds
- Indoctrination and ideological training facilities (loyalty conditioning, educational classrooms, isolated elite programs)

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must consider both the raw space available and the types of training that space could support. An underground complex might lack outdoor ranges but offer excellent simulation environments. An island provides outdoor space but may lack containment for weapons testing. The ideal location supports the full spectrum of training needs: physical conditioning, combat skills, tactical scenarios, equipment operation, and psychological conditioning.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Comprehensive training capacity across all domains; space for combat, weapons, tactics, conditioning, equipment testing, and indoctrination; could train and condition a complete evil army
2. Strong: Good training facilities with minor gaps addressable through supplementary arrangements; solid combat and conditioning space, adequate weapons facilities, reasonable simulation capacity
3. Adequate: Basic training possible; sufficient space for physical conditioning and basic combat, limited weapons facilities, minimal simulation or specialized training capacity
4. Limited: Minimal training capacity; space for basic physical training only, no weapons facilities, no specialized training infrastructure
5. Insufficient: No meaningful training capacity; location cannot support any systematic workforce development

## Task 4: Medical and Welfare Infrastructure Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the location's capacity to provide medical care and welfare support for an evil workforce facing distinctive occupational hazards.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Capacity for treating distinctive evil workplace injuries (laser burns, explosion trauma, hero encounter wounds, exotic injuries from radiation, chemicals, cryogenics, shark bites)
- Trauma surgery and emergency response capabilities
- Recovery and rehabilitation facilities
- Mental health support (existential counseling, hero-encounter trauma, isolation management, loyalty therapy)
- Family accommodation and support services for long-term retention
- Retirement and transition planning infrastructure
- Death benefits and memorial provisions

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must consider both physical medical infrastructure and broader welfare systems. Evil employment is inherently hazardous; sustainable operations demonstrate care for personnel through comprehensive support. A location that can house personnel but cannot treat their inevitable injuries will experience unsustainable attrition. The ideal location supports full medical care including exotic injury treatment, psychological support for the unique stresses of evil employment, and family/retirement provisions that incentivize long-term loyalty.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Full medical and welfare infrastructure matching or exceeding legitimate employers; comprehensive injury treatment including exotic cases, mental health support, family accommodation, retirement provisions; demonstrates organizational investment in personnel welfare
2. Strong: Solid medical capacity with some limitations in exotic injury treatment; adequate mental health support, reasonable family considerations, basic retirement planning
3. Adequate: Essential medical care available for common injuries; serious or exotic injuries require evacuation; limited mental health resources, minimal family or retirement provisions
4. Limited: Basic first aid and stabilization only; any significant injury requires external treatment; no mental health, family, or retirement infrastructure
5. Insufficient: No meaningful medical or welfare capacity; injuries cannot be treated, no support systems exist

## Task 5: Loyalty Maintenance Capacity Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the location's capacity to maintain organizational loyalty and prevent defection, infiltration, or mutiny.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Geographic isolation limiting outside contact and reducing exposure to heroic recruitment or moral reflection
- Communication control infrastructure (monitored channels, filtered media, controlled information access)
- Physical access control (difficulty of unauthorized exit)
- Surveillance infrastructure (physical observation, audio monitoring, digital tracking, social network analysis)
- Traitor identification and response capacity (interrogation facilities, isolation cells, disciplinary mechanisms)
- Environmental dependency creation (specialized adaptation making personnel less able to function in normal society, skill specialization, identity transformation, social network replacement)

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must consider how the location's characteristics support loyalty maintenance through both passive factors (natural isolation, environmental dependency) and active systems (surveillance, control). A location in a major city offers no isolation. An underwater base creates natural dependency. The ideal location combines natural isolation limiting outside influence with infrastructure supporting comprehensive surveillance and control, while creating conditions that make personnel psychologically and practically dependent on the organization.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Natural isolation and dependency factors maintain loyalty without excessive coercion; comprehensive surveillance infrastructure, complete communication control, physical exit difficulty, strong environmental dependency creation; personnel have no practical alternative to continued loyal service
2. Strong: Good isolation with some loyalty-maintenance measures required; solid surveillance capacity, reasonable communication control, moderate exit difficulty, some dependency factors
3. Adequate: Partial isolation requiring active loyalty maintenance programs; basic surveillance possible, communication monitoring challenging, exit possible with effort, limited dependency creation
4. Limited: Poor isolation with easy outside contact; minimal surveillance infrastructure, difficult communication control, simple exit, no dependency factors
5. Insufficient: No loyalty maintenance capacity; location provides no isolation, no surveillance potential, easy communication with outside world, trivial exit; personnel loyalty entirely dependent on individual motivation

## Task 6: Holistic Sustainability Tier Assessment

**Purpose**: Provide an integrated assessment of the location's overall evil workforce sustainability, synthesizing all five dimensions into a final tier classification.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Integration of living quarters potential, recruitment pipeline viability, training facilities capacity, medical/welfare infrastructure, and loyalty maintenance capacity
- Identification of critical weaknesses that limit overall sustainability regardless of other strengths
- Recognition of synergies where strengths in one dimension compensate for weaknesses in another
- Assessment of long-term operational viability for sustained evil workforce operations
- Consideration of the location's capacity to support the full evil employment lifecycle: recruitment, training, deployment, care, retention, and retirement

**Assessment Approach**: The evaluator must synthesize the individual dimension assessments into a holistic judgment. A location strong in four dimensions but completely lacking medical capacity cannot sustain operations. A location with exceptional isolation but impossible recruitment cannot be staffed. The evaluator should identify the binding constraint—the weakest dimension that limits overall sustainability—while recognizing that exceptional performance in other areas may partially compensate. The final tier should reflect the location's capacity to support evil workforce operations at scale over the long term.

**Response Options**:
1. Exceptional: Outstanding support for large-scale evil workforce operations indefinitely; no critical weaknesses, strong performance across all dimensions, capable of sustaining thousands of personnel through complete employment lifecycle
2. Strong: Can support substantial evil operations with minor compromises or supplements; may have one dimension at adequate level but compensated by exceptional performance elsewhere, capable of sustaining hundreds to low thousands
3. Adequate: Can support moderate evil operations with significant organizational effort; multiple dimensions at adequate level, requires active management of workforce challenges, suitable for dozens to hundreds of personnel or as secondary facility
4. Limited: Can support only small-scale operations; multiple critical weaknesses, suitable for outposts, relay stations, or temporary bases only, cannot sustain independent workforce operations
5. Insufficient: Cannot meaningfully support evil workforce operations; fundamental failures across multiple dimensions make the location unsuitable for workforce considerations regardless of other tactical merits

## Integration Notes

The function produces a probability distribution across the five tiers by combining the assessments from all six tasks. Tasks 1-5 provide dimensional assessments, while Task 6 provides the holistic integration. The final output should weight the holistic assessment heavily while using the dimensional assessments to inform confidence in that judgment.

Each task uses a vector.completion approach where the model votes on the most appropriate tier for that dimension. The dimensional scores contribute to understanding the location's profile, while the holistic assessment determines the final probability distribution.

A location might show:
- Exceptional living quarters + Strong recruitment + Adequate training + Strong medical + Exceptional loyalty → likely Strong or Exceptional overall
- Exceptional in four dimensions + Insufficient in one critical dimension → likely Adequate or Limited overall (the binding constraint principle)
- Adequate across all dimensions → likely Adequate overall (consistent mediocrity)

The function should produce honest probability distributions reflecting uncertainty. A location with mixed signals across dimensions should show probability mass spread across multiple tiers, while a location with consistent assessments should show concentrated probability in a single tier.
